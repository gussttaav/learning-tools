# Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Learning Projects Repository**. This is a collection of interactive, web-based visualizations I've built to explore and teach core concepts in machine learning and deep learning. Each project focuses on a specific algorithm, providing an intuitive and hands-on way to understand how it works through step-by-step execution and parameter adjustment.

## Unsupervised Learning

### 1. [DBSCAN Algorithm Visualization](https://github.com/gussttaav/learning-tools/tree/main/dbscan-visualization) [![Vercel Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-Live_Demo-blue?style=flat)](https://learning-tools-peach.vercel.app/)

An interactive web-based visualization tool for the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clustering algorithm. This project helps users understand how DBSCAN works by providing a step-by-step visual representation of the clustering process.

## Deep Learning

### 1. [2D Gradient Descent Visualization](https://github.com/gussttaav/learning-tools/tree/main/gradient-descend-2D) [![Vercel Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-Live_Demo-blue?style=flat)](https://gradient-descend2.vercel.app/)
A visual exploration of the gradient descent optimization algorithm in two dimensions. This tool allows you to experiment with different starting points and learning rates to see how they affect the path and convergence speed towards a local minimum.

### 2. [3D Gradient Descent Visualization](https://github.com/gussttaav/learning-tools/tree/main/gradient-descend-3D) [![Vercel Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-Live_Demo-blue?style=flat)](https://gradient-descend3.vercel.app/)
An extension of the 2D visualizer into three dimensions. This project illustrates the convergence of gradient descent on a 3D surface, offering a more spatial understanding of the optimization process. Adjust the initial point and learning rate to see the resulting descent path.
